# Hospital-delivery-system

Our  project is a database management system for the inventory of hospitals in the area. 
One is able to log in as either an inventory manager or a worker at the distribution center. 
It is the job of the inventory manager to keep the hospitals’ inventories updated and maintained. 
As items are ordered to the hospital, the inventory manager will be able to add elements to the database, adding stock as they arrive. 
They’ll also be able to update and delete elements from the inventory as they get used by other hospital workers among other useful features. 
This way, the application will be an effective way to constantly manage the hospital’s inventory from multiple levels. 
As there are different logs for deletions and additions, the stock of the database will always remain accurate, 
and looking up stock of certain equipment will also be easy as each item has a unique medical id and amount in storage.
